 *
 * BASE
 * All ..................... The Base layer consists of tools and helpers and
 *                           since they don't produce any CSS they can be glob
 *                           imported.
 *
 * CONFIG
 *
 *
 * ELEMENTS
 * Normalize ............... Levels out browser differences based on a
 *                           browserslist config file
 * Box-sizing .............. Default 'box-sizing'
 *
 *
 * LAYOUT
 *
 * PATTERNS
 * All ..................... Patterns should be componentized and un-independent
 *                           from each other. Thus, it should be safe to glob
 *                           import all patterns.
 *
 * UTILITIES
 * Shame ................... The place to put hacks and quick fixes. Just make
 *                           sure to refactor and distribute this shameful code
 *                           to where it really should reside.
